# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have not changed anything since my assignment reflection.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I really struggled with this entire semester due to poor time management and leaving some practicals
and lectures too late in the week and ended up rushing through them with very little time
before work of a sunday afternoon. I will watch my lectures on monday and tuesday this 
week.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I really did well in the first half of the semester, but the introduction to classes has
confused me a lot. I will try to practice as best as I can with classes in week 7, 
but I can only go back and redo the same material so many times, and if I don't 
understand classes, I don't understand classes.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I'm trying to follow the lectures and do this now exercises as much as possible.
I don't know what to change about learning this subject.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

It's hard to say. Sometimes I feel like we learn too much all at once, and I wish 
that I had more time and practice. but other times with programming, when I am picking
up the material and find it easy, it feels like the subject is moving too slow.
I don't know how to make this subject better. I think that there are things that 
I am really struggling with understanding the concepts in this subject, but I 
didn't have this problem in programming 1, so maybe I just need to continue practising?
