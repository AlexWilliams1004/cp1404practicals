# CP1404 Practicals

## Repository

This repo was designed and created for me, as a student, to complete my
weekly practical exercises for programming 2 (CP1404).

## Writing Clean Code

The main lessons that I have learnt about writing good, clean code are:

- Making sure to follow naming conventions. Code must be legible for myself and others.
- Using appropriate programming patterns to effectively provide practical solutions.
- Work incrementally on large programs. A big problem does not have to all be solved at once.

## About Me

My name is Alex, and I am completing a bachelor of IT at JCU, Townsville.

I enjoy the programming subjects the most so far, as they are much more
practical than most of the other subjects that I have had. I much prefer
practical learning as opposed to theory.

I enjoy hiking, running, and climbing. I have no pets, but want to get
a beagle. I hope that when I graduate I can get a good job as a back
end dev or a data analyst and do good work for my future employer.
